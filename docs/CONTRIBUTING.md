### Setup Development Environment
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies
4. Set up environment variables
5. Run the development servers

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phaser-game.git
cd phaser-game

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
cargo build

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development servers
cargo run  # Backend
npm run dev  # Frontend
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
We use a simplified Git flow approach:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Ensure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

### Commit Message Format
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(game): add multiplayer support
fix(auth): resolve JWT token validation issue
docs(api): update webhook documentation
test(backend): add integration tests for game service
refactor(frontend): optimize Phaser scene management
style(backend): format code with rustfmt
```

## üìù Code Standards

### Rust Code Standards
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting
- Use `clippy` for linting
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Use proper error handling with `Result<T, E>`

```rust
// Good example
pub struct GameService {
    db_pool: PgPool,
    redis_client: redis::Client,
}

impl GameService {
    /// Creates a new game service instance
    pub fn new(db_pool: PgPool, redis_client: redis::Client) -> Self {
        Self {
            db_pool,
            redis_client,
        }
    }
    
    /// Creates a new game with the specified parameters
    pub async fn create_game(&self, name: String, max_players: i32) -> Result<Game> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Standards
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use proper type annotations
- Write JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

```typescript
// Good example
export class GameService {
  private readonly apiClient: ApiClient
  
  constructor(apiClient: ApiClient) {
    this.apiClient = apiClient
  }
  
  /**
   * Creates a new game with the specified parameters
   * @param gameData - The game creation data
   * @returns Promise resolving to the created game
   * @throws {GameCreationError} When game creation fails
   */
  public async createGame(gameData: CreateGameRequest): Promise<Game> {
    try {
      const response = await this.apiClient.post('/games', gameData)
      return response.data
    } catch (error) {
      throw new GameCreationError('Failed to create game', error)
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Standards
- Use SQLx for type-safe database operations
- Write clear, readable SQL queries
- Use proper indexing for performance
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Document complex queries

```sql
-- Good example
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_games_status_created 
ON games(status, created_at);

-- Document complex queries
-- This query finds active games with players ready to start
SELECT 
    g.id,
    g.name,
    g.player_count,
    g.max_players,
    COUNT(gs.user_id) as ready_players
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN game_sessions gs ON g.id = gs.game_id AND gs.is_ready = true
WHERE g.status = 'waiting'
GROUP BY g.id, g.name, g.player_count, g.max_players
HAVING COUNT(gs.user_id) = g.max_players;
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing
- Write unit tests for all game logic
- Use Vitest for testing framework
- Test UI components with @testing-library
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Test edge cases and error conditions

```typescript
// Good test example
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { Game } from '../Game'

describe('Game', () => {
  let game: Game

  beforeEach(() => {
    game = new Game()
  })

  it('should initialize with correct configuration', () => {
    expect(game.config.width).toBe(1280)
    expect(game.config.height).toBe(720)
  })

  it('should handle player movement correctly', () => {
    const initialPosition = game.player.position
    game.movePlayer('right')
    expect(game.player.position.x).toBeGreaterThan(initialPosition.x)
  })

  it('should throw error for invalid move', () => {
    expect(() => game.movePlayer('invalid')).toThrow('Invalid direction')
  })
})
```

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for all services
- Use integration tests for API endpoints
- Test database operations with test database
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions and edge cases

```rust
// Good test example
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use sqlx::PgPool;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_create_game() {
        let pool = setup_test_db().await;
        let service = GameService::new(pool);
        
        let game = service.create_game("Test Game".to_string(), 4).await.unwrap();
        
        assert_eq!(game.name, "Test Game");
        assert_eq!(game.max_players, 4);
        assert_eq!(game.status, GameStatus::Waiting);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_create_game_invalid_players() {
        let pool = setup_test_db().await;
        let service = GameService::new(pool);
        
        let result = service.create_game("Test Game".to_string(), 0).await;
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }
}
```
