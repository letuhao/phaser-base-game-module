## Advanced Features Implemented

### 1. Strategy Composition Patterns

#### Weighted Average Composition:
```typescript
// Combines multiple strategies using weighted averaging
const result = weightedComposer.compose(value, unit, context, [
  { strategy: strategy1, weight: 0.6 },
  { strategy: strategy2, weight: 0.4 }
]);
```

#### Priority-Based Composition:
```typescript
// Selects highest priority strategy
const result = priorityComposer.compose(value, unit, context, strategies);
```

#### Adaptive Composition:
```typescript
// Dynamically adjusts weights based on performance
const result = adaptiveComposer.compose(value, unit, context, strategies);
```

### 2. Performance Caching System

#### LRU Cache with TTL:
```typescript
const cache = new StrategyCache<SizeValue, SizeUnit, number>(
  'size-cache', 
  1000,    // max size
  300000   // 5 minute TTL
);

// Cache operations
cache.set(value, unit, context, result);
const cached = cache.get(value, unit, context);
```

#### Intelligent Key Generation:
```typescript
// Context-aware cache keys
const key = `${value}:${unit}:${contextHash}`;
// Different contexts = different keys
```

### 3. Enhanced Performance Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Metrics:
```typescript
const metrics = {
  totalCalculations: number,
  cacheHits: number,
  cacheMisses: number,
  cacheHitRate: number,
  averageCalculationTime: number,
  strategyCompositions: number,
  cacheStatistics: CacheStats,
  composerMetrics: ComposerMetrics[]
};
```
