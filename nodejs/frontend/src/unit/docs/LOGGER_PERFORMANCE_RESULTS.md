## Issues Identified

### 🔍 **Minor Issues**

1. **Memory Measurement Limitation**
   - **Issue**: Chrome memory API not available in test environment
   - **Impact**: Cannot measure memory improvements
   - **Solution**: Use alternative memory measurement or skip memory tests

2. **Test Threshold Exceeded**
   - **Issue**: Performance improvements exceed test expectations
   - **Impact**: Tests fail due to overly conservative thresholds
